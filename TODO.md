# To do...

## Better MangaUpdates access
Need to improve access to MangaUpdates. Current just scraping it, but it's primitive and inaccurate.

## Adding Visual Novels and Light Novels
Might be worth adding visual novels and light novels to the bot.

## Improving AnimeBot.py's structure
All the regex is currently pretty gross. Need to tidy it up. Would also be good to prepare for any changes that need to be made on a subreddit-specific basis.
